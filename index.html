					Hello, my name is Eli Orona and this is my
					<del>bad</del>
					website. I'm not too sure what I should but here but it's a bio. I
					also dont want to go too deep because I'm pretty sure that no-one
					wants to know when I was born or my first word. Ok, to start I
					currently attend <a href="https://bsd405.org/sammamish/">Sammamish
						High School</a> in the <a href="https://bsd405.org/">Bellevue
						School District</a>. I am in the ninth grade. I participate in band,
					which includes marching band and concert band, playing the clarinet
					and bassoon. I am also part of the robotics team, <a
						href="https://www.robototes.com/">Robototes 2412</a> as a
					programmer. In my free time I like to play video games like
					Minecraft and Overwatch, <a href = "music.html">write music</a>, and code some cool things.
